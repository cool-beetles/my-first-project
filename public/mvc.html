      <p class="center-description">In case of web application, the main aim is to <strong> separate the user interface from business logic.</strong> This concept addresses client-server structure of this kind of software as well as backend and frontend diversity. A separation of visual part of application and its logic seems to be also reasonable because of fact that requirements of changes in interface and business logic can <strong>proceed independently</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="center-description"> All data operations, starting with retrieving them from database and ending with some complicated algorithms are performed by the Model. The most important fact is that it is working only with information, it has no knowledge about presentation. The entire role of this component is to handle information input and output.
      </p>
      <p class="center-description"> Everything, which is connected with presentation layer is encapsulated by the View. That include the DOM elements structure, the styling and browser scripts. In order to display correct content the View uses data from the Model, however the View itself has no power to manipulate the data.
      </p>
      <p class="center-description"> The most popular architectural pattern in web development is MVC. The role of <strong> connection </strong> between the Model and the View belongs to the Controller.
